# Personal Portfolio – Python Version

This repository contains the **Python-based reimplementation** of my personal portfolio.

The original project was initially generated using AI tools (JS-Version).  
This version is **not a direct translation**, but a deliberate **technical and conceptual rework**.

At this point, the project has evolved into something closer to a new system than a simple port.

## Project Nature

This project is an ongoing experiment in:

- backend-driven web logic
- multilingual accessibility
- system redesign and refactoring
- learning by rebuilding instead of copying

The goal is not to preserve the original structure, but to **understand it deeply and improve it**.

---

## Key Differences from the Original Version

- **Language shift**  
  JavaScript → Python

- **Backend architecture**  
  Custom Python logic instead of JS-based handling

- **Translation system**  
  Replaced Google-translate API/version-per-language translation with **Argos Translate**, enabling:
  - local execution
  - offline translation
  - reproducibility
  - better control over models

- **User Interface**  
  The visual design and layout are being reworked:
  - new GUI logic
  - different interaction model
  - cleaner structure
  - accessibility-oriented decisions
